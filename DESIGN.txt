Rustyra - concatenative multi-stack language.

Language - a way to talk to computer. We will change nothing here.

Concatenative - tokens are read from left to right, up to down. We
  don't have to build AST (abstract syntax tree). It's like a stream
  of commands and other tokens that we will feed to our compiler.

Multi-stack - there is one main stack. You can define other stacks if
  you want and have them communicate at the bottom (you can link some stacks
  to other stacks) so feeding data into operands can happen in many ways
  and output of some operations can land in different stacks.
